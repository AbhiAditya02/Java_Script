### 🎯 Guess The Number
[Live Link!!](https://java-script-1bi3.vercel.app/)

Just built a fun mini-project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — a Guess the Number game!

<b>How it works:</b>
<p>
    A random number (1–100) is generated.<br>
    The player has 10 attempts to guess it right.<br>
    The game gives real-time feedback — whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.<br>
    Once the game ends, a “Start New Game” button appears to restart instantly.<br>

    This project helped me strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, input validation, and game logic in JavaScript.
